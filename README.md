### Hel√¥!

Fy enw i yw emoose! I've been modding Xbox related things since I first got an Xecuter 2.6 for my original Xbox, some of my recent Xbox projects are:
- [xvdtool](https://github.com/emoose/xvdtool) - for manipulating the XVD images used by Xbox One
- [Xb2XInput](https://github.com/emoose/Xb2XInput) - for adding support for Xbox OG controllers to Windows
- [idaxex/xex1tool](https://github.com/emoose/idaxex) - for disassembling X360 XEX executables of nearly any vintage
- [xbox-winfsp](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-winfsp) - for mounting Xbox-specific file containers natively under Windows
- [stfschk](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-reversing/tree/master/stfschk) - for validating the integrity of Xbox360 STFS packages
- [xbox-reversing](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-reversing) - for pulling apart various Xbox360 formats such as XEX/STFS/GPD (with near-complete structures & reading code for each)
- [ExCrypt](https://github.com/emoose/ExCrypt) - for interoperability with X360's XeCrypt cryptography suite
- [XbRecUnpack](https://github.com/emoose/XbRecUnpack) - for fully unpacking Xbox/Xbox360 XDK recoveries/installers

I've also messed with taking games apart & trying to make them moddable, some of the modding projects I helped get started:
- [sh2proxy](https://github.com/emoose/sh2proxy) - a mod for Silent Hill 2, bringing fixups for modern machines (outdated - use [Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition](http://www.enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/) instead!)
- [DQXIS-SDK](https://github.com/emoose/DQXIS-SDK) - a mod for Dragon Quest XI S that allows easier modding through loose-file loading & enabling the dev-console, along with a few code fixes.
- [DQXIAsset](https://github.com/emoose/DQXIAsset) - a tool for (de)serializing / unpacking / decompiling the UE4 DataTables used by DQXIS.
- [MBINCompiler](https://github.com/monkeyman192/MBINCompiler) - a tool for (de)serializing No Mans Sky data files
- [DOOMExtract](https://github.com/emoose/DOOMExtract) - for extracting/repacking DOOM 2016 resources
- [ElDewrito](https://github.com/ElDewrito/ElDorito) - a client modification for Halo Online

If it wasn't obvious my favorite ISA is PowerPC, for being so clean and easy to learn/understand, along with being the ISA that first introduced me to Assembly too.
