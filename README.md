### Hel√¥!

Fy enw i yw emoose! I've been modding Xbox related things since I first got an Xecuter 2.6 for my original Xbox, some of my recent Xbox projects are:
- [xvdtool](https://github.com/emoose/xvdtool) - for manipulating the XVD images used by Xbox One
- [Xb2XInput](https://github.com/emoose/Xb2XInput) - for adding support for Xbox OG controllers to Windows
- [idaxex/xex1tool](https://github.com/emoose/idaxex) - for disassembling X360 XEX executables of nearly any vintage
- [xbox-winfsp](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-winfsp) - for mounting Xbox-specific file containers natively under Windows
- [stfschk](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-reversing/tree/master/stfschk) - for validating the integrity of Xbox360 STFS packages
- [xbox-reversing](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-reversing) - for pulling apart various Xbox360 formats such as XEX/STFS/GPD (with near-complete structures & reading code for each)
- [ExCrypt](https://github.com/emoose/ExCrypt) - for interoperability with X360's XeCrypt cryptography suite
- [XbRecUnpack](https://github.com/emoose/XbRecUnpack) - for fully unpacking Xbox/Xbox360 XDK recoveries/installers

I've also dabbled with taking games apart & trying to make them moddable, helping to start the [ElDewrito](https://github.com/ElDewrito/ElDorito), [MBINCompiler](https://github.com/monkeyman192/MBINCompiler) & [DOOMExtract](https://github.com/emoose/DOOMExtract) projects. 

If it wasn't obvious my favorite ISA is PowerPC, for being so clean and easy to learn/understand, along with being the ISA that first introduced me to Assembly too.
