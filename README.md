### Shwmae!

Ydy fy enw i emoose! In my free time I like to roleplay as a game modder/fixer, sometimes the fixes actually work! 

I've also been interested in console modding ever since I first got an Xecuter 2.6CE for my OG Xbox, most recently I've worked on:
- [xvdtool](https://github.com/emoose/xvdtool) - for manipulating the XVD images used by Xbox One
- [Xb2XInput](https://github.com/emoose/Xb2XInput) - for adding support for Xbox OG controllers to Windows
- [xbox-winfsp](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-winfsp) - for mounting Xbox/Xbox360-specific file systems natively under Windows
- [idaxex/xex1tool](https://github.com/emoose/idaxex) - for disassembling X360 XEX executables from almost any point in time (pre-beta Xenon executables onward!)
- [stfschk](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-reversing/tree/master/stfschk) - for validating the integrity of Xbox360 STFS packages
- [xbox-reversing](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-reversing) - for pulling apart various Xbox360 formats such as XEX/STFS/GPD (with near-complete structures & reading code for each)
- [ExCrypt](https://github.com/emoose/ExCrypt) - for interoperability with X360's XeCrypt cryptography suite
- [XbRecUnpack](https://github.com/emoose/XbRecUnpack) - for fully unpacking Xbox/Xbox360 recoveries/installers

I've helped to take some games apart to try making them moddable too, some projects that I helped with:
- [sh2proxy](https://github.com/emoose/sh2proxy) - a mod for Silent Hill 2, bringing fixups for modern machines (outdated - use [Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition](http://www.enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/) instead!)
- [MBINCompiler](https://github.com/monkeyman192/MBINCompiler) - a tool for (de)serializing No Mans Sky data files
- [DOOMExtract](https://github.com/emoose/DOOMExtract) - for extracting/repacking DOOM 2016 resources
- [DoomLegacyMod](https://www.reddit.com/r/DOOM2016Mods/comments/ahfv2q/doomlegacymod_v201901_updated_for_the_latest_doom/) - unlocks nearly all DOOM 2016 console-commands/variables, and even reimplements a few (noclip, infiniteHealth, noTarget...)
- [ElDewrito](https://github.com/ElDewrito/ElDorito) - a client modification/derestrictor for Halo Online.
- [Improved Lighting Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69833) - for Fallout New Vegas, allows extending the per-cell light-limit and helps eliminate lighting issues
- [Automata-LodMod](https://www.nexusmods.com/nierautomata/mods/165) - helps improve graphical quality in NieR Automata & patches in various improvements
- [re4_tweaks](https://github.com/nipkownix/re4_tweaks) - a wrapper DLL that improves the PC RE4 UHD port, bringing fixes & improvements that have been requested for years!

Finally, some mods/tools for UE4 games that I've made:
- [DQXIHook](https://github.com/emoose/DQXIHook) - mod for Dragon Quest XI that unlocks the UE4 dev console & allows loose-file loading (afaik this was the first publicly released UE console unlocking mod - methods used here still seem to work even for the latest UE versions too!)
- [DQXIS-SDK](https://github.com/emoose/DQXIS-SDK) - mod for Dragon Quest XI S that allows easier modding through loose-file loading & enabling the dev-console, along with some code/resolution fixes & added game features.
- [DQXIAsset](https://github.com/emoose/DQXIAsset) - a tool for (de)serializing / unpacking / decompiling the UE4 DataTables used by DQXIS.
- [Arise-SDK](https://github.com/emoose/Arise-SDK) - a mod for Tales of Arise that can improve graphics & help modders via dev-console access/loose-file loading.
- [FFVIIHook](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7remake/mods/74) - mod for FFVII Remake that unlocks dev-console & allows much easier INI modding.
- [Bloodstained Dialogue & Character Viewer Resolution Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodstainedritualofthenight/mods/144) - Increases render resolution of models during dialogue sequences & menu screens, no more locked 1080p!
