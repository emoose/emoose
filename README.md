### Hyl√¥!
[emoose yw fy enw i](tl "Welsh: my name is emoose"), I've been doing work on Xbox related things for too long to remember, you might know me from such hits as:
- [xvdtool](https://github.com/emoose/xvdtool) - for manipulating the XVD images used by Xbox One
- [Xb2XInput](https://github.com/emoose/Xb2XInput) - for adding support for Xbox OG controllers to Windows
- [idaxex/xex1tool](https://github.com/emoose/idaxex) - for disassembling X360 XEX executables of almost any vintage
- [xbox-winfsp](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-winfsp) - for mounting Xbox360-specific file containers natively under Windows
- [stfschk](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-reversing/tree/master/stfschk) - for validating the integrity of Xbox360 STFS packages
- [xbox-reversing](https://github.com/emoose/xbox-reversing) - for pulling apart various Xbox360 formats such as XEX/STFS/GPD (with near-complete structures & reading code for each)
- [ExCrypt](https://github.com/emoose/ExCrypt) - for interoperability with X360's XeCrypt suite
- [XbRecUnpack](https://github.com/emoose/XbRecUnpack) - for unpacking Xbox/Xbox360 XDK recoveries/installers

I've also dabbled with taking games apart & trying to make them moddable, helping to create the [ElDewrito](https://github.com/ElDewrito/ElDorito), [MBINCompiler](https://github.com/monkeyman192/MBINCompiler) & [DOOMExtract](https://github.com/emoose/DOOMExtract) projects. 

My language of choice is C# for being a good friend over the years, but I've also done my share of work in C/C++/Python/PHP/JavaScript as well.

If it wasn't obvious my favorite ISA is PowerPC, for being so clean and easy to learn/understand, along with being the ISA that first introduced me to Assembly too.
